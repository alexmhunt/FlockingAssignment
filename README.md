# Attack of the Boids
A simple implementation of the Boids algorithm in Unreal Engine 4 for IMGD4000 Assignment 1: Agent-Based Simulation.

Play as a brightly-colored cube and try to avoid the flock of murderous, cube-flesh hungry Boids for as long as you can!

Controls: WASD to move around, and look around using the mouse.


Developed by Alex Hunt
All Boids algorithm code implemented in C++, with only the score, health bar, and the game mode implemented in Blueprints.
