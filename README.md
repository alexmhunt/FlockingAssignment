# Attack of the Boids
A simple implementation of the Boids/Flocking algorithm in Unreal Engine 4 for IMGD4000 Assignment 1: Agent-Based Simulation.

Play as a brightly-colored cube and try to avoid the flock of murderous, cube-flesh hungry Boids for as long as you can!

Controls: WASD to move around, and look around using the mouse. If a Boid touches you, you lose some health. If your health hits zero, the game ends.

Developed by Alex Hunt.

All Boids algorithm code implemented in C++. Health, all HUD elements, and collision implemented in Blueprints.

Based off Conrad Parker's Boids pseudocode (http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html).
